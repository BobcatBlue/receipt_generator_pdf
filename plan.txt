Program does these things:
- display inventory dataframe as a table
- prompt user to choose an item to buy
- generates a PDF receipt of the item which is saved
- (optional) update the dataframe to reduce inventory of that item by
the quantity purchased

####################################
Receipt contains:
- Receipt number (based on item ID)
        f"Item No. {item_id}"
- Name of the item
- Amount paid

################################
Front End:
- Display the inventory table
- Prompt user to enter the ID of the item they'd like to purchase
- User enters the item id, and then the CLI ends the process there,
  but a PDF document is generated

##################################
CLASSES:

class Purchase
- There will be two (2) classes: Purchase and Receipt
- The Purchase class takes the item id, sets it to a self-variable,
  and also uses it to reference the dataframe to set variables
  for the item name and price / amount tendered
- *optional*  Purchase class can also update the "in stock" amount
  using a method

class Receipt
- The Purchase Object is then passed to the Receipt class,
  which uses all of Purchase's __init__ variables within a method
  to create the PDF object and then save it to a .pdf file in the
  project directory
